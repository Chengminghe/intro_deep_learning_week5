# Monet-style Image Generation Using CycleGAN

This project explores the use of CycleGAN, a variant of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), to recreate the unique style of Claude Monet in photos or generate new images in his style. CycleGAN can learn a mapping between two domains of images without requiring paired training data, which makes it a popular choice for image-to-image translation tasks such as painting style transfer.

The goal of this competition was to generate 7,000 to 10,000 Monet-style images using GANs or CycleGANs. This repository contains the code and documentation for the project, including dataset exploration, preprocessing, CycleGAN model training, and evaluation.

**Dataset**

The dataset used for this project is available at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/gan-getting-started/data). It includes 300 Monet paintings and 7,000 landscape photos. The dataset was explored and preprocessed before being used for model training.
